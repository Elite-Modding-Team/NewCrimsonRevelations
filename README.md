![All the Content](docs/mod_content.png)

**New Crimson Revelations** is a content addon for Thaumcraft 6 focused on adding more Crimson Cult related content to expand the lore and make the overall mod feel more complete and polished. This also serves as an unofficial continuation of the original Crimson Revelations mod by MobiusFlip, with most content of that mod intact and longtime issues fixed.

To access most of the new content, you'll need to unlock **The Crimson Cult** research by scanning a cultist and also obtain a Crimson Rites book dropped by them, you'll need it to fully unlock **The Crimson Rites** research. Once these are done, the Revelations category will immediately unlock and you can finally start progressing throughout the addon.
